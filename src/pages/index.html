<h1>Text on Images</h1>

<p>
    The decision to put text on images can make a design more visually appealing,
    but when the decision is part of a design system that must accommodate
    a large variety of possible combinations of text and image,
    you must take certain concerns into account
    and incorporate them into the design system as a whole.
</p>

<h2>What we see</h2>

<p>
    Suppose you are mocking up examples for a design system,
    and you are given 10 combinations of text and images
    to display in an overlapping manner.
    But in some cases, the text becomes illegible
    where it overlaps parts of the associated image
    that are not in high enough contrast with the text color.
</p>

<h2>What we often do</h2>

<p>
    As a designer or front-end developer,
    you have many possible workarounds at your disposal,
    and it is common to treat each combination differently
    according to its respective circumstances. For instance, you can:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Change the color of the text</li>
    <li>Insert line breaks and indentations at strategic positions in the text</li>
    <li>Shift the entire text field's position within the image</li>
    <li>Dim or brighten parts of an image where text contrast appears too low</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why it fails</h2>

<p>
    If your design system will become part of a CMS,
    then it will need to render potentially thousands of combinations of text and images,
    most of which you may never see while working on a few dozen hypothetical examples.
    The people responsible for writing the text, taking the photos, compiling the digital feeds,
    and managing the layouts will not necessarily have your advantage of visualizing the final result.
    They will not necessarily be able to visit every combination of text and image
    and apply some equivalent of the workarounds that you used when creating the mock examples.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>
    A design system for rendering managed content <em>must</em> work properly
    for all possible combinations of content without the need to inspect and hand-customize each one.
    </strong>
</p>

<h2>What we can do better (with examples)</h2>

<p>
    Here is a typical example of a contrast legibility problem.
    The black text is not legible because much of it overlaps black or nearly black regions of the background image.
</p>

<div class="banner">
    <div class="banner__text">Hello, world. Greetings, universe. Salutations, cosmos.</div>
</div>

<div class="banner white">
    <div class="banner__text">Hello, world. Greetings, universe. Salutations, cosmos.</div>
</div>

<p>
    This image is an extreme case but perfectly realistic.
    Circumstantial fixes such as switching text color are not universally feasible.
    Any hand-customizations that you must resort to within your design system
    transfers the same burden to content managers, who have to deal with much more data
    and don't necessarily have the design or development tools to facilitate these workarounds.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>
        Don't blame the data for faults that lie with the design system itself.
    </strong>
</p>

<h3>Text Shadow</h3>

<p>
    The <code>text-shadow</code> CSS property
    lets you control the color, offset, and blur radius.
    Simply by wrapping the text in a faint glow,
    you can significantly improve legibility with minimal visual effect.
</p>

<div class="banner banner--text-shadow">
    <div class="banner__text">
        Hello, world. Greetings, universe. Salutations, cosmos.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="banner white banner--text-shadow">
    <div class="banner__text">
        Hello, world. Greetings, universe. Salutations, cosmos.
    </div>
</div>

<h3>Text Outline</h3>

<p>This is essentially a very crisp text shadow.</p>

<div class="banner banner--text-outline">
    <div class="banner__text">
        Hello, world. Greetings, universe. Salutations, cosmos.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="banner white banner--text-outline">
    <div class="banner__text">
        Hello, world. Greetings, universe. Salutations, cosmos.
    </div>
</div>

<h3>Text Haze</h3>

<p>This is the text shadow with a much larger blur radius.</p>

<div class="banner banner--text-haze">
    <div class="banner__text">
        Hello, world. Greetings, universe. Salutations, cosmos.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="banner white banner--text-haze">
    <div class="banner__text">
        Hello, world. Greetings, universe. Salutations, cosmos.
    </div>
</div>


<h3>Text Background Strip</h3>

<p>
    An easy, low-fidelity solution is to set the <code>background-color</code> CSS property of the text element.
    This example uses a semi-opaque text background color.
</p>

<div class="banner banner--text-background">
    <div class="banner__text">Hello, world. Greetings, universe. Salutations, cosmos.</div>
</div>

<div class="banner white banner--text-background">
    <div class="banner__text">Hello, world. Greetings, universe. Salutations, cosmos.</div>
</div>


<h3>Level the image</h3>

<p>
    If your implementation uses the <code>background-image</code> CSS property,
    you can add a <code>linear-gradient</code> transform
    to increase contrast for whatever text color you use.
</p>

<div class="banner banner--image-gradient">
    <div class="banner__text">Hello, world. Greetings, universe. Salutations, cosmos.</div>
</div>

<div class="banner white banner--image-gradient">
    <div class="banner__text">Hello, world. Greetings, universe. Salutations, cosmos.</div>
</div>
